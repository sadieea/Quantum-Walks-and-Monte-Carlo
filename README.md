## üìù Project Summary (500 words)

This project explores the simulation of a Quantum Galton Box, a powerful analogy for Monte Carlo methods used in complex systems. Drawing inspiration from the principles outlined in the "Universal Statistical Simulator" paper, this work demonstrates how quantum circuits can efficiently model probabilistic processes that are foundational to fields like particle transport and quantum systems analysis. The primary goal was to execute the entire workflow of a quantum simulation project: from designing an algorithm for an ideal, noiseless environment to implementing it on a realistic noisy model and, finally, applying error mitigation techniques to improve the fidelity of the results.

The project began with the implementation of a generalized quantum walk circuit capable of simulating a Galton Box with any number of layers. In this ideal model, a Hadamard gate applied to an ancilla qubit acts as a perfect quantum coin, creating an equal superposition to simulate a 50/50 probability at each step of the walk. When run on a noiseless simulator, this circuit was verified to produce the expected binomial distribution, which approximates a Gaussian curve for a sufficient number of layers. This served as the theoretical baseline for the project. Next, to showcase the versatility of the quantum walk model, I modified the circuit to generate a custom, non-uniform probability distribution. By replacing the standard Hadamard gate with a parameterized Y-rotation (RY) gate, I engineered a "biased" quantum coin. This allowed for the creation of a skewed binomial distribution that closely resembles a decaying exponential curve, highlighting the model's flexibility beyond simple symmetric random walks.

The most critical phase of this investigation was analyzing the impact of realistic hardware noise. I ran the standard binomial walk simulation on a noise model based on IBM's `FakeVigo` backend, which incorporates real-world gate errors, decoherence, and connectivity constraints. As expected, the results from this "noisy baseline" showed a noticeable deviation from the ideal theoretical curve, demonstrating how easily noise can corrupt quantum computations. To address this, I implemented a fundamental error mitigation technique: **transpiler-based circuit optimization**. By using Qiskit's `transpile` function at its highest optimization level, the original circuit was recompiled into a more efficient version with reduced depth and gate count, making it inherently more resilient to the effects of noise.

The final analysis quantitatively confirms the success of this mitigation strategy. Using the Hellinger Distance to measure the error between the simulated and ideal distributions, the optimized noisy simulation showed a **49% reduction in error** compared to the unoptimized noisy baseline. This result brings my simulation's accuracy remarkably close to that of the ideal, noiseless case, validating that software-level optimizations are a powerful and essential tool for achieving meaningful and reliable results on today's near-term, noisy quantum computers. The project successfully demonstrates the entire workflow, from theoretical modeling on ideal simulators to practical implementation and effective error mitigation on realistic hardware models.

## ‚ú® Key Results & Findings

The primary finding of this project is the quantifiable success of using software-level error mitigation. As the plot below shows, the unoptimized "Noisy Baseline" simulation had a significant Hellinger Distance from the ideal distribution. By simply applying the highest level of transpiler optimization, I was able to reduce this error by nearly half.

## üìà Performance Metrics & Conclusion

This table summarizes the final performance metrics for each simulation run, focusing on the accuracy (KL Divergence) and the computational cost (Execution Time).

| Simulation              | KL Divergence | Execution Time (s) |
| :---------------------- | :------------ | :----------------- |
| **Ideal Binomial** | 0.0001166      | ~0.16              |
| **Ideal Exponential** | 0.000102      | ~4.46              |
| **Noisy Baseline** | 0.0015      | ~0.13              |
| **Optimized Noisy** | 0.0002      | ~0.14              |

**Conclusion:** The results demonstrate the successful implementation of the Quantum Galton Box. The extremely low KL Divergence values for the ideal and optimized noisy runs confirm a high degree of accuracy and a close match to the theoretical target distributions. The significantly higher KL Divergence for the "Noisy Baseline" run quantifies the impact of hardware noise, while the **86.67% reduction in this error** for the "Optimized Noisy" run validates transpilation as a powerful and effective error mitigation technique. The execution times show that all simulations were performed efficiently on the classical simulator.
